## Calculating PI using MonteCarlo Method
### This is the result of calculating

### Explaination of this design
Pi = (4 * circleArea) / squareArea
But how do we know the circleArea without knowing Pi?
Here we use points:
- First we generate random points
- Those that fall in the cirlce represent the area of the circle: **circleArea**
- The total number of points represents the area of the square: **squareArea**
